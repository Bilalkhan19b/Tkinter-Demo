# Tkinter-Demo
This repository is created for building GUI using tkinter which is a built-in module in python.

In this project, I created a simple login page using tkinter module of python.
The correct email is "abc@gmail.com" and correct password is "1234".
If you enter the correct credentials a message box will appear which says login successful,
and if you enter invalid credentials a error message will appear.
